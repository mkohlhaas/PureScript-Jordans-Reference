# Contributor Guidelines

- Before submitting a PR, open an issue to discuss what you want to do
    - Your ideas are likely good, but may not be aware of the full context.
    - Why do work that might be a waste of your time if I disagree and decide not to merge it?
- PRs should be merged into the `latestRelease` branch
    - allows me to continue working on `development` branch without needing to worry about merge conflicts until later
    - allows me to force-push to the `development` branch if need be without overwriting your commits
