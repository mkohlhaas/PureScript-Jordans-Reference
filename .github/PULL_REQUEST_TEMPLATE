Instructions
- Open an issue to discuss what you want to do before submitting a PR
    - Your ideas are likely good, but may not be aware of the full context.
    - Why do work that might be a waste of your time if I disagree and decide not to merge it?
- PRs should be merged into the `latestRelease` branch
    - allows me to continue working on `development` branch without needing to worry about merge conflicts until later
    - allows me to force-push to the `development` branch if need be without overwriting your commits
- Any images, GraphML files, etc. should go in a folder called "assets" that is a sibling to the files where it is used. Then all references will abide by this pattern `./assets/imageName.png`

Once the above has been done, open a PR and delete this content.
