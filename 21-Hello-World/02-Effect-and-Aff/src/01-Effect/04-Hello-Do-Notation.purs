-- A refresher on 'do-notation'

-- This chain of functions via log
main' ∷ Effect Unit
main' = (log "This is outputted first") >>=
  ( \_ →
      (log "This is outputted second") >>=
        ( \_ →
            log "This is outputted third"
        )

-- can become more readable using sugar syntax (do-notation):
main ∷ Effect Unit
main = do
  log "This is outputted first"
  log "This is outputted second"
  log "This is outputted third"
