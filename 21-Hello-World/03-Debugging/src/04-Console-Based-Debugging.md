# Console-Based Debugging

A library that may be useful to use when debugging is `purescript-debugger` ([`3.0.0`'s source code](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-debugger) & [`2.0.0`'s docs](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-debugger/2.0.0)). This library's latest release is `3.0.0`, but the updated docs have not been pushed to Pursuit yet. I'm not sure what changed

I will not cover this library here (though I might later). I'm including it, so that you are aware of it in the future once we've covered more things.
